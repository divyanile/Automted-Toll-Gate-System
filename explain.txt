License Plate Detection using YOLOv3

YOLO abbreviates to You Only Look Once depicting its ability to detect objects and entities by using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).Neural Network in YOLO uses weights trained by the user through annotated training data by using bounding boxes. Hence YOLO takes an image as input puts it through a Neural Network and gives the output in the image through bounding boxes.
